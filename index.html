            Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow
            across borders. Where countries facilitate movement of goods and
            speed to market, customs exams, reduce red tape, and eliminate
            roadblocks. Where companies receive goods and merchandise directly
            into a Free Trade Zone without paying duties, fees, and taxes and
            then export products duty and tax free or imports from the Free Zone
            for domestic consumption. Free Trade Zones connects the commerce of
            North America, Europe, and Asia to Latin America and the Caribbean
            via direct air, sea, and over the road transportation links.
